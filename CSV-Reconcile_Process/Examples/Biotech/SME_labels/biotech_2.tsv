cultivar: A combination of “cultivate” and “variety,” a cultivar is a variety that has been carefully selected and bred for by plant breeders. Cultivars often will not breed true, creating offspring that do not resemble the parent plants. In forest trees, cultivars would be propagated and deployed as specific families or clones and they will not breed true since either they are based on additive and non-additive genetic value or their pollinators may be related, causing inbreeding depression.
