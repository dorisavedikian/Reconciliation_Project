cotton gin	A machine that separates raw cotton fibers from their seeds.
cotton ginning	The process of using a cotton gin machine to separate the cotton seed from the lint.

seed cotton	Unginned cotton which consists of the seed with the attached lint as picked from the boll.
lint cotton	Cotton fibers that have been removed from the seed during the cotton ginning process.

cotton modules	Sets of packages used to transport compressed seed cotton from a field to a cotton gin.
bales	
cotton bales	A package of compressed ginned cotton lint.
square bales	
round bales	
lint yield	The quantity of cotton fiber produced per unit of land.
balers	A machine that picks up a windrow of forage, compresses it, forms it into a rectangular or cylindrical bale, wraps it, and discharges it either onto the ground or into a trailing, convenient hauling vehicle. Bale size is highly variable among models.
round module baler	Machine that wraps seed cotton into a round module.
color grade (cotton)	The color of cotton fibers as rated using industry-standard grades.
staple (fibers)	Short fibers cut to a specific length to be twisted together to form a yarn for weaving or knitting into fabrics, or for tufting into carpets. Cotton, flax, and wool exist only as staple fibers. Nylon and polyester are synthetic fibers available in staple form.
staple length (cotton)	Length of a cotton fiber in thirty-seconds of an inch (Upland cotton) or thirtieths of an inch (Pima cotton).
micronaire	A combined measure of cotton fiber fineness and maturity based upon fiber perimeter and fiber wall thickness.
bundle strength (cotton)	The maximum stress sustained by a bundle of cotton fibers loaded to failure.
leaf grade (cotton)	A visual representation of how much plant matter remains in cotton after ginning.
extraneous matter (cotton)	Any substance in a cotton sample other than fiber or leaf.
cotton gin trash	Cotton seed coat fragments that are shattered or torn off during ginning and appear in the fibers as contaminants for yarn production.
length uniformity index (cotton)	Ratio of the mean length of a sample of cotton fibers to the mean length of the longest half of fibers.
seed cotton yield	The amount of cotton yielded by given unit of land, typically measured either as total harvested biomass, which includes leaf and trash, or as the mass of ginned lint only.
seed cotton yield (harvested biomass)	
seed cotton yield (ginned lint)
