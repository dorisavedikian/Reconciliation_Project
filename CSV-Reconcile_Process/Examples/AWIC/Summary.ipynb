Because alt and pref labels that correspond to a given concept / resource has the same URI, the openRefine reconciliation service will not work. So, I used a derivative of Tom Baker's [nalt_label.ipynb](https://github.com/woody544/nalt4ma/blob/main/nalt/nalt_labels.ipynb) jupiter notebook to keep the nalt pref labels and nalt alt labels seperate so that I could try and run the reconciliation on each file seperately.\n",
