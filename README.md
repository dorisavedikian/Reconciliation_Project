# Reconciliation_Project


## This  Repo  is  to  document  the  reconciliation  process. 

Original [nalt_label.tsv](https://github.com/dorisavedikian/Reconciliation_Project/blob/main/nalt_labels_DATA/nalt_labels.tsv) file has 145,755 rows

After splitting it into two files...

- nalt_preflabel.tsv had 76,932 rows ---> reconciled to beta prepared.tsv resulted in [739 reconciled nalt terms](https://github.com/dorisavedikian/Reconciliation_Project/blob/main/Reconciled/beta%20prepared%20pref_labels_only_reconciled.xls)

- nalt_altlabel.tsv had 68,823 rows ----> I added a suffix to each URI so they would be considered unique and I ran the service and it worked.


I aggregated the outputs and there are 749 nalt terms in the beta prepared csv
